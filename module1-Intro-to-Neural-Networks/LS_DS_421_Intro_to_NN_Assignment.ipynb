    "## Define the Following:\n",
    "You can add image, diagrams, whatever you need to ensure that you understand the concepts below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Layer (Visible Layer)** - The layer is composed of artificial input neurons, and brings the initial data into the system for further processing by subsequent layers of artificial neurons. The input layer is the very beginning of the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hidden Layer** - A layer in between the input layer and output layer, where artificial neurons take in a set of weighted inputs and produce an output through an activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Layer** - The purpose of the output layer is to output a vector of values that is in a format that is suitable for the type of problem being addressed. Typically the output value is modified by an \"activation function\" to transform it into a format that makes sense in the context of that problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neuron** - The elementary unit in an artificial neural network. The neuron receives one or more inputs and sums them to produce an output (or activation). Usually each input is separately weighted, and the sum is passed through a non-linear function known as an activation function or transfer function. The transfer functions usually have a sigmoid shape, but they may also take the form of other non-linear functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weight** -  The strength or amplitude of a connection between two nodes. This is similar to slope in linear regression, where a weight is multiplied to the input to add up to form the output. Weights are numerical parameters which determine how strongly each of the neurons affects the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activation Function** - The function that decides, whether a neuron should be activated or not by calculating weighted sum and further adding bias with it. The purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Node Map:** - A visual diagram of the architecture(topology) of a neural network. Like a flow chart it shows the path from inputs to outputs. They are usually color coded and help show, at a very high level, some of the differences in architecture between kinds of neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perceptron** - A single node or neuron of a neural network with nothing else. It can take any number of inputs and spit out an output.\n"
